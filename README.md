# city-population-annual-time-series-analysis
This project analyzes the City Population Annual Timeseries dataset from the UN Statistics Division to understand population trends across cities from 1972 to 2014. The goal is to evaluate population changes over time, investigate population distributions by city type and sex, and develop predictive models for future population estimates.
